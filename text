1. Introduction

This IT Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) establishes the necessary procedures to mitigate risks, restore systems, and ensure operational resilience in the event of a disruption. The plan outlines roles, responsibilities, and step-by-step actions to recover IT infrastructure, data, and critical business applications.

2. Objectives

Minimize downtime and data loss.

Ensure a structured response to IT disruptions.

Restore critical systems and applications efficiently.

Maintain compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements.

3. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

Potential Threats: Cyberattacks, natural disasters, hardware failure, software corruption, human error.

Mitigation Strategies: Regular backups, cybersecurity measures, redundant infrastructure, cloud-based recovery solutions.

4. Roles & Responsibilities

IT Director: Oversees disaster recovery execution.

System Administrators: Responsible for restoring systems and applications.

Backup & Storage Team: Ensures data restoration from backups.

Communication Team: Notifies stakeholders and employees about the recovery process.

5. Data Backup & Recovery Strategy

A. Backup Status and Location

On-Site Backups: Daily incremental and weekly full backups stored on local NAS devices.

Off-Site Backups: Weekly encrypted backups stored in a secure, geographically separated data center.

Cloud Backups: Real-time replication of critical data to a cloud storage provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).

Configuration Backups: Firewall, network devices, and server configurations backed up weekly.

B. Backup Retention Policy

Daily backups retained for 7 days.

Weekly backups retained for 1 month.

Monthly backups retained for 1 year.

Annual backups retained for 5 years.

6. Disaster Recovery Procedures

A. Initial Response & Assessment

Activate the IT Disaster Recovery Team.

Assess the nature and severity of the disruption.

Contain threats (e.g., isolate affected systems, shut down compromised servers).

Notify stakeholders and provide an estimated recovery timeline.

B. System Restoration

Verify Backup Integrity: Check that the latest backup files are complete and uncorrupted.

Recover Critical Systems First: Prioritize restoring:

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems

Database servers

Email and communication systems

Core applications and file servers

Network Restoration: Restore firewall, VPN, and security configurations.

Verify System Functionality: Conduct testing to ensure restored systems operate correctly.

Incremental User Access: Gradually allow user access while monitoring system stability.

7. Business Continuity Measures

Alternative Work Locations: Enable remote work for employees if on-premises access is disrupted.

Failover Systems: Implement standby servers and cloud failover to reduce downtime.

Incident Communication: Provide real-time updates via email, company intranet, or emergency notification system.

8. Post-Recovery Actions

Conduct a post-mortem review to assess root causes and areas for improvement.

Update disaster recovery documentation based on lessons learned.

Test and refine the DRP annually to ensure effectiveness.

9. Testing & Maintenance

Conduct quarterly backup recovery tests to verify data integrity.

Perform annual full-scale disaster recovery drills to assess readiness.

Update DRP documentation as IT infrastructure and risks evolve.

10. Conclusion

This IT Disaster Recovery Plan ensures that the organization is prepared to handle IT disruptions efficiently, minimizing operational impact while maintaining data security and system integrity. Regular updates and testing of the plan are critical to its success.
